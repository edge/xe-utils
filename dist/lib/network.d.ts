 * An XE Client is any distributed app instance that can be uniquely identified by an XE address.
 * It may communicate with other XE Clients or externally operated servers.
 *
 * A given class of XE Client may operate behind the same hostname. For example, all Stargates run on
 * `stargate.edge.network` - but they must also be individually addressable by Edge systems.
 *
 * XE networking generally consists of two parts:
 *
 * 1. The Client sends a self-identification message to a Server
 * 2. The Server verifies and handles the message, and thereafter can send arbitrary messages to the Client
 *
 * In this library, a standard Client-to-Server network protocol is provided using JSON over HTTP.
 * This enables identification, verification, and subsequent status checks.
 * Further networking capabilities are specific to, and should be built into, the respective Client and Server
 * applications.
