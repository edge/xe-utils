## Usage

This library provides a collection of simple functions for interacting with the XE blockchain, plus attendant features.

> API functions expect a `host` URL for the blockchain API to be provided as the first argument. This must be provided without a trailing slash. The standard URLs are:
>
> - Mainnet: <https://api.xe.network>
> - Testnet: <https://xe1.test.network>
>
> All code examples use the mainnet URL for simplicity.

### On-chain variables

The XE blockchain exposes on-chain variables including staking amounts, release fee, and more. You can access these with the [core](lib/index.ts) `vars()` function:

```js
const xe = require('@edge/xe-utils')

async function main() {
  const vars = await xe.vars('https://api.xe.network')
  console.log(vars)
}

main()
```

### Transactions

The [tx](lib/tx.ts) component provides the ability to list and create transactions.

#### Get transactions

`tx.transactions()` gets a list of the most recent transactions, or transactions within a specific block range.

```js
const { tx } = require('@edge/xe-utils')

async function main() {
  let txs = await tx.transactions('https://api.xe.network')
  console.log(txs)

  txs = await tx.transactions('https://api.xe.network', { from: 159335, to: 159345 })
  console.log(txs)
}

main()
```

#### Get pending transactions

`tx.pendingTransactions()` gets a list of pending transactions, optionally for a specific wallet address.

```js
const { tx } = require('@edge/xe-utils')

async function main() {
  let txs = await tx.pendingTransactions('https://api.xe.network')
  console.log(txs)

  txs = await tx.pendingTransactions('https://api.xe.network', 'xe_ed9e05C9c85Ec8c46c333111a1C19035b5ECba99')
  console.log(txs)
}

main()
```

#### Create transactions

`tx.sign()` creates a signed transaction. `tx.createTransactions()` then submits one or more signed transactions to the blockchain.

> This is not a working example: you will need to substitute correct values for `my-wallet-address`, `other-wallet-address`, and `my-private-key`. See [Wallet](#wallet) for more on this.

```js
const { tx } = require('@edge/xe-utils')

async function main() {
  const myTx = sign({
    timestamp: Date.now(),
    sender: 'my-wallet-address',
    recipient: 'other-wallet-address',
    amount: 1e6,
    data: { memo: 'example of sending 1 XE' },
    nonce: 1
  }, 'my-private-key')

  const res = await tx.createTransactions('https://api.xe.network', [myTx])
  console.log(res)
}

main()
```

> Note that the `amount` of a transaction is specified in microXE (mXE). 1 XE is 1,000,000 mXE. If dealing in XE amounts in user code, you should multiply by 1,000,000 (1e6) when preparing a transaction to get the correct `amount`.

### Stakes

The [stake](lib/stake.ts) component provides access to on-chain staking information.

#### Get stakes

`stake.stakes()` gets a list of stakes for a specific wallet address.

> This is not a working example: you will need to substitute a correct value for `my-wallet-address`. See [Wallet](#wallet) for more on this.

```js
const { stake } = require('@edge/xe-utils')

async function main() {
  const myStakes = await stake.stakes('https://api.xe.network', 'my-wallet-address')
  console.log(myStakes)
}

main()
```

#### Get a stake

`stake.stake()` gets a stake by its hash.

> This is not a working example: you will need to substitute a correct value for `my-hash`.

```js
const { stake } = require('@edge/xe-utils')

async function main() {
  const myStake = await stake.stake('https://api.xe.network', 'my-hash')
  console.log(myStake)
}

main()
```

Alternatively, `stake.stakeByTx()` gets a stake by wallet address and transaction hash. This can be useful if the stake hash is not available.

> This is not a working example: you will need to substitute correct values for `my-wallet-address` and `my-hash`.

```js
const { stake } = require('@edge/xe-utils')

async function main() {
  const myStake = await stake.stakeByTx('https://api.xe.network', 'my-wallet-address', 'my-hash')
  console.log(myStake)
}

main()
```

### Wallet

The [wallet](lib/wallet.ts) component provides standard XE wallet features, plus the underlying cryptographic functions for advanced usage.

#### Create a wallet

`wallet.create()` generates a new wallet.

```js
const { wallet } = require('@edge/xe-utils')

async function main() {
  const myWallet = wallet.create()
  console.log(myWallet)
}

main()
```

#### Recover a wallet

`wallet.recover()` recovers a wallet from a private key.

> This is not a working example: you will need to substitute a correct value for `my-private-key`. If you do not have a private key already, youÂ may need to [create](#create-a-wallet) one instead.

```js
const { wallet } = require('@edge/xe-utils')

async function main() {
  const myWallet = wallet.recover('my-private-key')
  console.log(myWallet)
}

main()
```

#### Get wallet balance and nonce

There are two functions for getting on-chain wallet information:

- `wallet.info()` gets the current available balance and nonce
- `wallet.infoWithNextNonce()` is slightly slower, but gets the current available balance and _next_ nonce, accounting for any pending transactions

```js
const { wallet } = require('@edge/xe-utils')

async function main() {
  let info = await wallet.info('https://api.xe.network', 'xe_ed9e05C9c85Ec8c46c333111a1C19035b5ECba99')
  console.log(info)

  info = await wallet.infoWithNextNonce('https://api.xe.network', 'xe_ed9e05C9c85Ec8c46c333111a1C19035b5ECba99')
  console.log(info)
}

main()
```

#### Validation

The functions `wallet.validateAddress()` and `wallet.validatePrivateKey()` provide a simple way to validate wallet information in user code before touching the XE blockchain.

```js
const { wallet } = require('@edge/xe-utils')

async function main() {
  if (!wallet.validateAddress('invalid-wallet-address')) console.error('invalid address')
  if (!wallet.validatePrivateKey('invalid-private-key')) console.error('invalid private key')
}

main()
```

### Request callbacks

All API wrapper functions accept a `RequestCallback` as their final argument. This can be used to control request behaviour from your own code using [SuperAgent's chaining API](https://visionmedia.github.io/superagent/).

For example, if you wanted to specify a 100ms timeout on a request for transactions, you could do:

```js
const { tx } = require('@edge/xe-utils')

async function main() {
  let txs = await tx.transactions('https://api.xe.network', undefined, req => req.timeout(100))
  console.log(txs)
}
```

> Note that undefined arguments cannot be omitted, as we do not provide overloaded functions in this library. You can write your own wrapper to simplify this if you prefer.
